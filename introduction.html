                <p>My name is Feng Gao, who is currently enrolled in Georgia Insititute Of Technology. It is my sophomore year and also a tough year. Due to Covid 19, I was unable to study on campus and had to online courses that were under a totally different time zone with mine.I decided to set my major as Computational Media, because myy dream is to be a <strong>software engineer</strong>, especially in the field of games.</p>
                <p><small>Still, hope you all stay safe!</small></p>
